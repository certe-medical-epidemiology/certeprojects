\arguments{
\item{remote_file_name}{Name of the file to search, will be used together with \code{project_number} and can be a regular expression. Will be passed on to \code{\link[=project_get_file]{project_get_file()}}.}

\item{project_number}{Planner project number}

\item{full_sharepoint_path}{Full path of the remote file, consisting of the project folder and the file name, such as \code{"Project - p123/my_file.R"}.}

\item{account}{a Microsoft 365 account to use for looking up properties. This has to be an object as returned by \code{\link[=connect_teams]{connect_teams()}} or \code{\link[Microsoft365R:client]{Microsoft365R::get_team()}}.}

\item{overwrite}{Whether to overwrite an existing file.}

\item{local_file_name}{File name of the local file.}

\item{...}{arguments passed on to \code{\link[=source]{source()}}}

\description{
These functions allow for fast and easy transfer between local files and SharePoint, using \code{\link[=teams_projects_channel]{teams_projects_channel()}} to retrieve the Projects channel.
}
\details{
You must either provide \code{remote_file_name} + \code{project_number}, or provide \code{full_sharepoint_path}.
\itemize{
\item \code{download_from_sharepoint()} finds a SharePoint file in the \link[=teams_projects_channel]{Projects channel} using \code{\link[=project_get_file]{project_get_file()}}, and downloads it to a local temporary folder. The local filename is returned and can be used in other functions.
\item \code{upload_to_sharepoint()} uploads any local file to SharePoint in the \link[=teams_projects_channel]{Projects channel}. The remote path is returned and can be used in other functions.
\item \code{source_sharepoint()} runs \code{\link[=source]{source()}} on a SharePoint project file, by downloading it to a temporary folder first using \code{download_from_sharepoint()}.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{

source_sharepoint(download_from_sharepoint("my_file.R", 123))

"my_file.R" |>
