\description{
This is a Shiny app to add a new project: it creates a project folder locally \link[=connect_teams]{or in Teams}, generates the required Quarto or R Markdown or R file, and creates a \link[=connect_planner]{new task in Planner}. These functions come with RStudio addins to quickly access existing projects. For consults, it only adds a Planner task and creates the card in the background.
