\description{
These functions create a connection to Microsoft Teams via Microsoft 365 and saves the connection to the \code{certeprojects} package environment. The \verb{teams_*()} functions allow to work with this connection.
}
\details{
When attaching this package using \code{\link[=library]{library()}}, and external R process will be run to connect to MS Teams, to increase speed when connecting using \code{\link[=teams_connect]{teams_connect()}}.

The \code{\link[=teams_new_project]{teams_new_project()}} function:
\enumerate{
\item Checks if there is a Planner task with the correct task title
\item Creates a new folder in Teams in the projects channel
\item Updates the task to contain the project folder URL as an attachment
}

The \code{\link[=teams_download_project_file]{teams_download_project_file()}} function will download the given project file to a temporary location, and will return the path of this location. This makes it possible to use \code{\link[=source]{source()}}, \code{\link[rmarkdown:render]{rmarkdown::render()}} or \code{\link[quarto:quarto_render]{quarto::quarto_render()}} using the \code{\link[=teams_download_project_file]{teams_download_project_file()}} function as input.

The \code{\link[=teams_render_project_file]{teams_render_project_file()}} function allows to render a Teams file. It downloads the Teams file using \code{\link[=teams_download_project_file]{teams_download_project_file()}}, runs the rendering function set in \code{fun}, and uploads the resulting output file back to Teams using the same file name a \code{file}, but with the new file extension (such as pdf, html, or docx). It \strong{invisibly returns} the temporary local file location, so that the output of \code{\link[=teams_render_project_file]{teams_render_project_file()}} can be given to e.g. \code{\link[certemail:mail]{certemail::mail()}} as an attachment.

# PROJECT-RELATED --------------------------------------------------------

# Project-related Teams function rely on existing Planner tasks.

# create a new project, which will be a folder in the Teams channel
# for this, the task 'My Planner task' must already exist
teams_new_project("My Planner task")

# the task 'My Planner task' will now contain the URL to the project

# upload a file there
teams_upload_project_file("analysis.Rmd", "My Planner task")

# render R markdown or Quarto from and to the cloud
teams_render_project_file("analysis.Rmd", "My Planner task")
# this will put the output file in the same Teams folder as 'analysis.Rmd'


# PROJECT-UNRELATED ------------------------------------------------------

teams_upload("myfile.docx", channel = "My Channel")

# also supports data frames, they will be saved locally in a temp folder
